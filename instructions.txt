Always wrap pages with div only [Because Navbar is coded to add padding to next div automatically].

Don't change the header in the excel sheet (sheet from where data is fetched from), if changing then change it in the code also.

Row Number is used as a parameter to connect Directory to Profile

Don't leave href empty it ion-icon will throw error (use <Link> instead of <a> tag)
